"""The errors of the windowed app, kept in a file.

A program started from the desktop has nobody reading its stderr: the
Windows build has no console at all (the entry point points the streams at
the null device), the desktop on Linux hands it to the journal, which
nobody opens. A traceback of a button's callback, which PyGObject prints
and then carries on, or a `log.complain`, would leave no trace. Here
stderr becomes a tee: what it wrote before still goes where it went (the
console, the journal), and it also goes to `errors.log` in the state
folder, with the date and time before each burst of lines.

The file does not grow without end: past MAX_BYTES it becomes
`errors.log.1` (the one before is dropped) and a new one starts. Nothing
goes on the network; the file holds what a traceback holds and no more.

The module knows no app and no toolkit: install() is told the file."""
